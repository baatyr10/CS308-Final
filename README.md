# CS308 Final project 
## Computer organization & architecture

## Project

The primary purpose of this project was to implement the desired function in both C and Assembly in order to study the differences. Initially the program requests the user to input both n and k. After gathering this information and storing it the program checks if the values are equal to each other, and if so it proceeds to do the factorial of n and outputs that as the final result. If both numbers are not equal the program runs a loop that will go through each (n-k) and multiply it with the previous sum, and then decrement k. After doing this loop the program will then do the final n times the sum of all the previous multiplications. This total will then be displayed to the user.
